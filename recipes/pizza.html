    <p>This is a recipe from my great grandma, mama short cakes, that is o so 
        delicious! Once you sink your teeth into this pie, you'll never want to 
        eat any other pie!

    <p>By following these simple steps, you too can bring some of mama short
        cakes seasonal cooking to your kitchen.  Remember, if you're not cooking 
        with heart, you might as well just fart.
